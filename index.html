            What is the collected money used for ?

        </summary>
        <p class="text">NAME is neither a company nor the project of a private individual, it is an association under the 1901 law. These associations have the specificity of being non-profit. In other words, it generates no benefit for the members of the said association. So no salary is paid and no McDo / Burger King is bought with the precious money you spend.</p><p class="text">AloneDay, it doesn't tell me where the money goes! It's true, here I come! The money is used to pay for the dashboard servers and the two bots. It can also be used to access services for NAME, such as better documentation or an uptime site. In any case, it is spent carefully and always in your interest.</p>

          Can I be refunded if it does not suit me ?

        </summary>
        <p class="text">Since this is the very beginning of setting up subscriptions, it is not yet possible to be reimbursed.
          Once everything is correctly set up, and on a solid foundation, I would indeed like to be able to provide you with a means of reimbursement if unfortunately you were to be disappointed with your purchase.</p>
